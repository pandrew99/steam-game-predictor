# steam-game-predictor

In this assignment for CSE 158, we were given a Steam dataset and were tasked to make predictions on whether or not a user would play a new game, and how long they would play that game. We submitted onto a leaderboard where our accuracy was compared to the rest of the class (with ~600 people in total). Overall, I ended up ranking in the top 25% of the class.
